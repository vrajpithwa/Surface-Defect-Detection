## Source of the data：
           The data comes mainly from viaduct in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province.

## Type of data:
- Our team has published two kinds of data sets,as follows:
  - [1]Bridge_Crack_Image_Data, the data set is mainly used to train the DBCC model;
  - [2]Original_Crack_DataSet_1024_1024,the data set is used to test the DBCC model and contains 2068 bridge crack image with a resolution of 1024 * 1042 and it is
       available online：http://pan.baidu.com/s/1bplPrPl
- The data set is primarily used to study the detection and extraction algorithms of bridge cracks and is not allowed for commercial purposes;
